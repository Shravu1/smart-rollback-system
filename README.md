🚀 Smart Deployment Rollback System

📋 Overview Smart Deployment Rollback System is an intelligent, automated solution designed to detect deployment failures in real-time and safely revert applications to their last known stable state. Unlike traditional rollback mechanisms, this system employs machine learning, comprehensive health monitoring, and adaptive strategies to minimize downtime and user impact.

Built for modern cloud-native environments, it seamlessly integrates with existing CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration platforms, and monitoring stacks to provide enterprise-grade deployment safety.
